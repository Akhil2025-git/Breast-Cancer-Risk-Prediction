# Breast-Cancer-Risk-Prediction
Developed a breast cancer risk prediction system using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit, leveraging patient diagnostic data to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. Applied data preprocessing techniques such as missing value ,label encoding, and feature scaling to enhance model performance. Fine-tuned a Random Forest Classifier using GridSearchCV, optimizing hyperparameters for improved predictive accuracy. Evaluated the model using accuracy,precision, recall, F1-score and Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve. Deployed the model through a Streamlit web app with a clean and intuitive interface for real-time risk prediction, incorporating input validation and user-centric design to improve usability. The project demonstrates practical ML application in healthcare and proficiency in deployment.
