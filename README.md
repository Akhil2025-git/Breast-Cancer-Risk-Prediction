# Breast-Cancer-Risk-Prediction
Built a breast cancer risk prediction system using Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. Developed a complete ML pipeline with data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning (Random Forest + GridSearchCV), and evaluation using classification metrics and survival analysis. Deployed via a user-friendly Streamlit app for real-time risk prediction.
